# Dashboard Error Fix Summary - 'inv_no_normalized'

## 🚨 Issue Resolved: 'inv_no_normalized' Error

**Date**: August 31, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Dashboard now running without errors

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

The error `'inv_no_normalized'` was occurring because the dashboard methods were trying to access the `inv_no_normalized` column before it was created. This happened in several locations where:

1. **Data subsets were created BEFORE normalization**
2. **Normalization was applied to the main dataset**  
3. **Subsets tried to access normalized columns that didn't exist**

### Specific Problem Locations:

1. **`analyze_payment_status()` method (Line ~2446)**
   - `unpaid_grns` subset created before `inv_no_normalized` column
   - Code tried to access `unpaid_grns['inv_no_normalized']` → **ERROR**

2. **`analyze_supplier_linking()` method (Line ~2849)**
   - Duplicate normalization causing confusion
   - Inconsistent column creation timing

## 🔧 Solution Implemented

### 1. **Fixed Data Flow Order**
```python
# BEFORE (Incorrect):
grn_analysis = grn_df.copy()
paid_grns = grn_analysis[condition]  # Subset created first
grn_analysis['inv_no_normalized'] = normalize()  # Normalization after
unpaid_grns['inv_no_normalized']  # ERROR: Column doesn't exist in subset

# AFTER (Correct):
grn_analysis = grn_df.copy()
grn_analysis['inv_no_normalized'] = normalize()  # Normalization first
paid_grns = grn_analysis[condition]  # Subset inherits normalized columns
unpaid_grns['inv_no_normalized']  # SUCCESS: Column exists
```

### 2. **Eliminated Duplicate Normalization**
- Removed redundant `inv_no_normalized` creation lines
- Ensured normalization happens once at the beginning of each method
- Consistent column availability across all data subsets

### 3. **Methods Fixed**

#### **`analyze_payment_status()` - Lines 2399+**
- ✅ Added `inv_no_normalized` creation before subsetting
- ✅ Removed duplicate normalization line
- ✅ Ensured all subsets have access to normalized columns

#### **`analyze_supplier_linking()` - Lines 2760+**
- ✅ Added `inv_no_normalized` to initial data preparation
- ✅ Removed duplicate normalization
- ✅ Fixed column access timing
