# Business Logic Updates Complete

## ✅ Dashboard Enhancement Summary

The enhanced dashboard has been successfully updated with corrected business logic and data relationships. All major components now implement the proper linkages as documented in `DATA_RELATIONSHIP_ANALYSIS.md`.

---

## 🔗 Corrected Data Relationships Implemented

### 1. Issue → HR390 Movement Data Linkage
- **Connection**: `HR995Issue.Requisition No` ↔ `HR390.reference`
- **Purpose**: Links internal requests to movement documentation
- **Implementation**: Normalized reference matching with leading zero handling

### 2. GRN → HR185 Transaction Linkage  
- **Connection**: `HR995GRN.Inv No` ↔ `HR185.reference`
- **Purpose**: Links goods received notes to supplier transaction records
- **Implementation**: Proper reference normalization for accurate matching

### 3. GRN → Voucher Payment Linkage
- **Connection**: `HR995GRN.Voucher` ↔ `HR995VOUCHER.Voucher No`
- **Purpose**: Links goods receipts to payment authorization
- **Implementation**: Voucher reference validation and payment tracking
