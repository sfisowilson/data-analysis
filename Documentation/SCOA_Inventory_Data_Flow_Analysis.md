## Detailed Data Flow Process

### STEP 1: REQUISITION & AUTHORIZATION
1. Department requests stock/supplies
2. Requisition created in SCOA system
3. Budget/Vote authorization required
4. **HR995issue.xlsx** records authorization details:
   - Requisition Number (becomes HR390 ISS reference)
   - Item Number, Quantity, Cost
   - Vote Number (budget authorization)
   - Authorized issue date
5. **Status**: AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUE

### STEP 2: GOODS RECEIPT (if new stock)
1. Supplier delivers goods
2. GRN (Goods Received Note) created
3. **HR995grn.xlsx** records receipt authorization
4. **HR390** records GRN transaction:
   - GRN adds to inventory (Stock IN)
   - Brought Forward + GRN = New Balance
5. **Status**: STOCK RECEIVED & AVAILABLE

### STEP 3: STOCK ISSUE/RELEASE
1. Authorized requisition processed
2. Stock issued from store to department
3. **HR390** records ISS transaction:
   - Reference = HR995 Requisition Number
   - ISS subtracts from inventory (Stock OUT)
   - New Balance - ISS = Carried Forward
4. **Cross-reference validation**:
   - HR390 ISS reference ‚Üí HR995issue requisition
   - Quantities and values must match
   - Vote numbers must be consistent
5. **Status**: STOCK ISSUED & CONSUMED

### STEP 4: FINANCIAL PROCESSING
1. Payment to supplier authorized
2. **HR995vouch.xlsx** records payment details
3. **HR185** tracks supplier transaction history
4. **HR990** aggregates expenditure by user/department
5. **Status**: FINANCIALLY PROCESSED

### STEP 5: RECONCILIATION & REPORTING
1. Period-end stock reconciliation
2. HR390 Carried Forward ‚Üí Next period Brought Forward
3. Stock Balances reports validate totals
4. Variance analysis for discrepancies
5. **Status**: RECONCILED & AUDITABLE
