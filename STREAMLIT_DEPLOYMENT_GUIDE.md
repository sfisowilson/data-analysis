# 🚀 Streamlit Community Cloud Deployment Guide

## ✅ **Free Streamlit Community Cloud Deployment**

Deploy your stock analytics dashboard to Streamlit Community Cloud for **free** with global access!

## 📋 **Prerequisites**

1. **GitHub Account** (required for Streamlit Community Cloud)
2. **Repository on GitHub** (we'll help you set this up)
3. **Your current Bitbucket repository** (we'll migrate/mirror it)

## 🎯 **Deployment Steps**

### **Step 1: Create GitHub Repository**

Since Streamlit Community Cloud requires GitHub, we need to create a GitHub repository:

1. **Go to GitHub**: https://github.com
2. **Create new repository**:
   - Name: `stock-analytics-dashboard`
   - Description: `Stock Data Analytics Dashboard with Interactive Visualizations`
   - Visibility: `Public` (required for free tier)
   - Initialize: Leave unchecked (we'll push existing code)

### **Step 2: Push to GitHub**

We'll add GitHub as an additional remote and push your code:

```bash
# Add GitHub as additional remote
git remote add github https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/stock-analytics-dashboard.git

# Push to GitHub
git push github main
```

### **Step 3: Deploy to Streamlit Community Cloud**

1. **Go to Streamlit Community Cloud**: https://share.streamlit.io
2. **Sign in** with your GitHub account
3. **Deploy new app**:
   - **Repository**: `YOUR_USERNAME/stock-analytics-dashboard`
   - **Branch**: `main`
   - **Main file path**: `enhanced_dashboard.py`
   - **App URL**: Choose your custom URL (e.g., `your-app-name`)

### **Step 4: Configuration Files**

We'll create the necessary configuration files for optimal deployment.

## 🔧 **Required Files for Deployment**

The following files are needed for proper Streamlit Community Cloud deployment:
