# ✅ Branch Merge Successfully Completed!

## 🔧 **What Was Done**

### **Problem**: 
- You had an existing `main` branch in the Bitbucket repository
- We initially pushed to `master` branch
- Needed to merge both branches to unify the codebase

### **Solution Applied**:

1. **✅ Identified Both Branches**:
   - `main` branch: Original repository branch (commit: 3884aa3)
   - `master` branch: New stock analytics code (commit: 7403e55)

2. **✅ Merged main into master**:
   - Used `git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories`
   - Resolved `.gitignore` conflict by combining both versions
   - Created merge commit (d7a32a0)

3. **✅ Synchronized Both Branches**:
   - Pushed merged `master` branch: `git push origin master`
   - Updated `main` branch with merged content: `git push origin master:main`
   - Both branches now contain the complete stock analytics platform

## 📊 **Current Repository Status**

### **Both Branches Now Contain**:
- ✅ Complete stock analytics dashboard (7 tabs, 35+ charts)
- ✅ Data processing pipeline (169K+ records)
- ✅ Static HTML export for IIS hosting
- ✅ PDF extraction capabilities
- ✅ All business objective reports (100% compliance)
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Deployment scripts and guides

### **Unified .gitignore**:
```gitignore
# Python-specific ignores (from your project)
__pycache__/, *.py[cod], .venv/, etc.

# General ignores (from original main branch)  
node_modules/, *.class, *.jar, etc.

# Combined comprehensive coverage
```

## 🌐 **Repository Access**

### **Both branches are now identical and contain**:
- **URL**: https://bitbucket.org/sfisowilson/data-analysis.git
- **Main Branch**: `main` (recommended for new clones)
- **Master Branch**: `master` (contains same content)

### **Clone Commands**:
```bash
# Clone main branch (recommended)
git clone https://bitbucket.org/sfisowilson/data-analysis.git
cd data-analysis

# Or specify branch explicitly
git clone -b main https://bitbucket.org/sfisowilson/data-analysis.git
```

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

### **Recommended**:
1. **Use `main` branch** as your default going forward
2. **Set main as default** in Bitbucket repository settings
3. **Future commits** should go to `main` branch

### **Repository Settings** (Optional):
- Go to Bitbucket repository settings
- Set `main` as the default branch
- This ensures new clones use `main` by default

## ✅ **Success Summary**
